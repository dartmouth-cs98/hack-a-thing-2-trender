# Description

### For this project I wanted to work with something visual. I decided to dive into javascript animations, which I hadn't previously worked with but had wished I'd been familiar with in the past. I began with a Lynda tutorial (in the Tutorial 1 folder) on vanilla javascript (https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Vanilla-JavaScript-Animations/688546-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a2%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3ajavascript+animation%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2). I had a few more tutorials in mind, but then ended up getting pulled into a simulation of rain which I think is kind of dope :) It began with a tutorial and starter code here (https://www.html5canvastutorials.com/advanced/html5-canvas-rain-effect/) which just put in the raindrops themselves, but I did math and animation to create the waves, splashes, rising water levels, bubbles, and indents.

# Who Did What

### I wanted to work with a partner for this assignment, but these 7 days are the craziest of my term with leading sorority rush and being off campus for interviews. With my wacky schedule I didn't think I'd be a good collaborator as I wouldn't be able to achieve appropriate levels of communication or working in the same place/same time. I worked with Morgan for the first Hack-A-Thing, so I'm glad I at least got a bit of time in a group.

# What I Learned

### Tons about javascript and inserting it into a web product! I also realized that VS Code has a built in extension that will open your code with a live server which was DOPE for this scenario when I didn't want to deal with setting up a weback and such. I also refreshed some math knowledge and learned that when you are drawing 1000 raindrops falling per frame and doing math on them, your computer will shut down due to workload. I also realized I love visual work and implementing math and physics in code to made realistic simulations.

# How Does This Hack-A-Thing Inspire You?

### I think real-world simulations are really powerful and really interesting to create. I've been trying to think of a way to use them that isn't just like "oh that's cool it looks like rain", but maybe something about mapping and simulating the world around us or even putting time into really cool visual videos that explain science concepts or something involving education would be up my alley.

# What Didn't Work

### I began wanting to work with ArcGIS which is GIS Mapping software. GIS Mapping was suggested as a topic by multiple people we interviewed, so I thought it would be cool to get familiar with it. Unfortunately, I spent a ton of time resesarching and even started a tutorial on Lynda (https://www.lynda.com/ArcGIS-tutorials/ArcGIS-Pro-Essential-Training/509438-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a4%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3aarc+gis%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) before realizing that Arc GIS only makes products for windows computers. They had some online functionality, but it was relatively minimal and I wasn't sure how I would submit it to GitHub so I pivoted. There were also a few JS issues I ran into, like the overheating of my computer with all the computations on my raindrops. I also tried to use a few tools (Sellenium, PhantomJS) at first to grab data and parse it from Google's website on Google search trends (trends.google.com) but was unable to figure out how to navigate to the page, click and harvest results using JS (still unsure if this is possible).
